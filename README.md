# minipedia
Wikipedia viewer built off instruction from freeCodeCamp

Tryin' some wacky shit this time and coding in Coffee-script and SaSS, then compiling w/ Grunt (Compass and Coffee packages), and minimizing the css & js. Is it overkill for what will be a fairly basic one-page app? Oh, absolutely. But I figure it'll help get my feet wet with a bunch of technologies and languages I don't have much experience with. New things I'm learning for this project are:
* Node.js / npm
* SaSS / Compass
* Coffeescript
* Grunt (and thus: JSHint, Uglify, MinCSS, Coffee compiler, SaSS compiler, etc.)

...so, yeah, this could turn into a bug fucking disaster.
(leaving that in)

Planned Features:
* Search functionality of Wikipedia
* Ability to get random page from Wikipedia

Hopeful Features:
* Open Wikipedia pages within minipedia page/div and apply custom styling to wiki css
* Learning / imitating the search bar animation from the CodePen example
